Technical Challenges while modifying the dustbin to a smarter most one :


1.Advanced Waste Classification – Accurately distinguishing between biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste using sensors.

2.Optimized Proximity Detection – Ensuring the lid opens only when a person intends to throw waste, avoiding unnecessary activations.

3.Faster Lid Operation – Achieving ultra-fast lid response for users in motion without affecting durability.

4.Reliable Fullness Detection – Precisely measuring waste levels with a load cell and preventing false alerts.

5.Odor Control & Prediction – Predicting and alerting users before odor starts developing in biodegradable waste.

6.Power Efficiency & Portability – Enabling battery/solar-powered operation to eliminate continuous power dependency.

7.Weather & Environmental Resistance – Making the sensors and components function reliably under various environmental conditions.

8.Real-Time Data Display – Implementing a small screen or mobile integration to display waste levels and system status.

9.Smart Alerts & Notifications – Adding IoT connectivity to send mobile alerts when the dustbin is full or emitting odor.

10.Sustainability & Cost Management – Balancing high-tech features with affordability and ease of maintenance.
